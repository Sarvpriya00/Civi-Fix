# 🏙️ Civi-Fix

Civi-Fix is a *citizen grievance redressal platform* designed to streamline how civic issues are reported, managed, and resolved.  
It bridges the gap between *citizens and municipal bodies* by providing an easy-to-use web platform for complaint submission, classification, and tracking.  

This project was built as part of the *Smart India Hackathon (SIH)*.
